Myth 1: Carbon Pricing Will Hurt Economic Growth1
Any program to reduce pollution will have economic costs as well as benefits. After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch. But a common myth about carbon pricing is that it will significantly hurt the economy. The Trump Administration’s retreat from a climate policy in 2017 is emblematic. In initiating a process to withdraw the United States from the global Paris Agreement, for example, the President claimed that the cost to the US economy of the Paris Agreement would be “close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs…” (Trump, 2017).

But how large are the costs? One way to assess that is to look at the impact of existing carbon taxes on economic growth. Until recently, there was little work in this area and most analyses relied on the use of large-scale computable general equilibrium models such as the E3 model of Goulder and Hafstead (2017). Using their model, Goulder et al. (2019) find that a $40 per ton carbon tax with an annual rate increase of 2 percent real leads to discounted GDP costs over the 2016-2050 period of less than one-third of one percent of GDP.
Metcalf and Stock (forthcoming) summarize the empirical work. Metcalf (2019a), for example, uses a difference-in-difference analysis of the British Columbia carbon tax, comparing that province to other Canadian provinces over the 1990-2016 time period and finds, if anything, a modest impact of the tax on GDP. In that paper I argued that this is plausible once one accounts for the use of the revenue to lower existing taxes in the province, an example of a double dividend (viz Goulder, 1995). Using a vector autoregression approach, Bernard and Kichian (2021) find no impact of the BC carbon tax on provincial GDP. Turning to Europe, Metcalf and Stock (2020, forthcoming) use a variety of time series macroeconomic methods to measure the impact of carbon taxes on economic growth. Let me discuss the results of Metcalf and Stock (forthcoming) in a bit more detail as it is the more comprehensive of the two analyses.
In that paper, we examine carbon taxes employed in 15 European countries, some of which have been in place for over 30 years now. Finland was the first European country to enact a carbon tax in 1990 and was soon followed by a number of other countries, many in the Nordic region, with this idea of using carbon tax revenue to finance reductions in income tax rates. To isolate impacts of the carbon taxes, they include in their analysis so-called EU+ countries, countries that are part of the EU Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). By including these 31 countries, they can control for changes in the EU-ETS over time as it became increasingly stringent, and isolate the additional impacts of the carbon taxes

themselves in the 15 countries with those taxes. Figure 2 from Metcalf and Stock (forthcoming) illustrate the variability both in rate and across time for the carbon tax rates.
They estimate the dynamic effect on GDP growth of the unexpected component of the carbon tax using the Jordà (2005) local projection (LP) method, adapted to panel data. Specifically, they use OLS to estimate a sequence of panel data regressions,

where 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the coverage-weighted real carbon tax rate for country i at date t, and 𝛩𝛩ℎ is the effect of an unexpected change in the carbon tax rate at time t on annual GDP growth h periods hence. The vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 includes ln(GDP), ln(total employment), ln(manufacturing employment), and the GDP price deflator. Note in Equation (1) the presence of country and year fixed effects. The former control differences across countries in the propensity to adopt a carbon tax and mean growth rates that could be correlated. They include year effects for two reasons: 1) the European countries in the sample share common political pressures, which could induce common changes in carbon prices, and have common economic influences. These common influences, even if exogenous, could appear as confounders, so they identify the effect of the tax increase from country-level surprises in carbon prices after controlling for common movements (year effects); and 2) even if year effects are not needed for identification, because of common macroeconomic movements (such as the global recession of 2009), including year effects could reduce standard errors.
One concern with their approach is the possibility of simultaneity. Poor economic outcomes could lead policy makers to reduce carbon tax rates (or postpone scheduled increases). They address this issue as follows. It is useful to think of changes to a carbon tax as having two components, one responding to historical economic growth, the other being unpredicted by past growth. Changes in the latter category could include tax changes based on historically legislated schedules, changes in ambition based on the environmental preferences of the party in power, or responses to international climate

policy pressure. Their identifying assumption is that this latter category of changes – those not predicted by historical own-country GDP growth and current and past international economic shocks – are exogenous. Hence, the inclusion of lags in the model. They present results by producing impulse response functions (IRF’s) for a counterfactual of a one-time permanent increase in the carbon tax by $40, for a tax that covers 30% of the country’s emissions, a coverage rate that is close to the sample mean. They compute this dynamic response from the LP and SVAR impulse responses using the method in Sims (1986), which entails computing the sequence of shocks necessary to yield the specified counterfactual carbon tax increase. Specifically, they model a $40 policy shock with a sequence of small adjustments. The small adjustments keep the carbon tax at $40 instead of tracking its own IRF with respect to its own shock. Figure 3 shows a representative IRF. This is from a version of the model that assumes the long run growth rate is not affected but rather only near term growth rates are affected. Theory suggests that long run GDP growth rates are driven more by fundamentals than by policy variable such as tax rates. Figure 3 shows that there is no significant impact on GDP growth, either in a positive or a negative direction. But as Figure 2 demonstrates, a number of countries have very low carbon tax rates. The pattern illustrated in Figure 3 persists when they limit the sample to countries with higher carbon tax rates – countries with share weighted tax rates of at least $10 per ton (corresponding to a tax rate of $30 a ton covering one-third of emissions). See Figure 4. They get similar results when focusing on countries who explicitly use carbon tax revenues to lower existing tax rates, when they focus on Scandinavian countries only, or other cuts of the data.

Why do CGE models appear to overestimate the adverse impact that carbon taxes supposedly have on GDP growth? A recent paper by Finkelstein Shapiro and Metcalf (2021) hints at an answer. In a CGE model that includes endogenous firm creation and technology adoption, they find that a carbon tax

designed to reduce emissions by 35 percent – roughly the reduction called for in the Biden Administration Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement – leads to modest positive increases in long-run output. When the technology adoption and firm creation channels are turned off, as is the case in most CGE models used for climate policy analysis, they find the carbon tax leads to significant adverse impacts on GDP. While more work needs to be done to understand the mechanisms behind these results, they point to greater flexibility and resilience in the U.S. economy than most models predict.
Summing up, a burgeoning literature on the economic impact of carbon taxes finds no evidence for significant adverse impacts of carbon taxation on economic growth. With the expansion of carbon pricing globally, there will be more opportunities for researchers to empirically test the hypothesis that carbon pricing is bad for the economy (ignoring the benefits of reducing emissions). But so far, the evidence does not support that view. Indeed, once firm creation and technology adoption are incorporated into modelling, carbon taxes may lead to modestly positive impacts on economic output (in addition to the environmental benefits).

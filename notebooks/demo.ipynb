Generally, it is recommended that you establish a consistent sleep schedule and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Depending on what time you need to wake up in the morning, you can set a bedtime that allows you to get enough rest. For example, if you need to wake up at 6am, you should aim to go to bed between 9pm-11pm. Ultimately, the best bedtime for you depends on your individual needs and schedule.\n",

      "Please summarise this abstract for me in plain english: We propose a theory that analyzes how a workers’ asset holdings affect their job productivity. In a labor market with uninsurable risk, workers choose to direct their job search trading off productivity and wages against unemployment risk. Workers with low asset holdings have a precautionary job search motive, they direct their search to low productivity jobs because those offer a low risk at the cost of low productivity and a low wage. Our main theoretical contribution shows that the presence of consumption smoothing can reconcile the directed search model with negative duration-dependence on wages, a robust empirical regularity that the canonical directed search model cannot rationalize. We calibrate the infinite horizon economy and find this mechanism to be quantitatively important. We evaluate a tax financed unemployment insurance (UI) scheme and analyze how it affects welfare. Aggregate welfare is inverted U-shaped in benefits: the insurance effect UI dominates the incentive effects for low levels of benefits and vice versa for high benefits. In addition, when UI increases, total production falls in the economy while worker productivity increases.\n",

      "This abstract suggests that workers' savings can affect how well they perform at work. If workers have low savings, they may focus on finding jobs that offer more security, even if they pay less. However, if a worker has a way to smooth out their income (such as through unemployment insurance), they may be more willing to take higher-paying, higher-productivity jobs. The study also examines how increasing unemployment insurance benefits can affect the overall economy and workers' welfare.\n",

      "Consumption smoothing is a financial strategy that aims to maintain a steady level of spending over time by saving during periods of higher income or wealth and spending during periods of lower income or wealth. In the context of this abstract, the authors suggest that workers with low asset holdings may choose low productivity jobs with low wages to minimize their income volatility if they are concerned about a sudden drop in their income or if they lack the ability to smooth consumption over time. However, if they have a method for smoothing out their income, such as unemployment insurance, they may feel more comfortable taking higher-paying jobs that have higher levels of productivity. Therefore, the ability to smooth consumption has an impact on workers' job choices and productivity.\n",
